# About

**Burp2Caido** is a tool that allows you to migrate exported Burpsuite HTTP history files into Caido. It was originaly developed by [Monke](https://github.com/projectmonke).

> [!WARNING]
> This tool inserts HTTP data directly into the Caido project. Running it multiple times WILL add the requests again each time. Run it once!

## Installation

`go install -v github.com/caido-community/burp2caido@latest`

## Usage

The tool takes two command-line arguments.

- `--burp` specifies where the HTTP history XML file is.
- `--caido` specifies where the Caido project folder is.

1. Open Burpsuite, and select your project. Navigate to the Proxy tab, and highlight the requests you want to export, right click and select "Save Items". Name your XML file something memorable and save it, and remember the path.
2. Create a new, empty Caido project. Navigate to the **Workspace** tab and click the three dots to the right, and select "Copy Path".
3. Run the following command, replacing the placeholders with the two paths above: `burp2caido --burp <burpsuite path> --caido <caido path>`
4. If you switch out of your new Caido project and switch back to it, you should see the traffic in the HTTP History tab in Caido.

## Found a bug?

Thanks for using our tool! We do our best to make sure the tool is updated as the file structure of Caido evolves but it might be broken at times.

Please open an issue if you face any problem üôè
